# Module 3: AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)

This module covers perception systems and navigation, teaching you how robots interpret their environment and move safely. You'll learn about Isaac Sim, VSLAM, and Nav2 for humanoid movement.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Explain Isaac Sim for photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation
- Describe Isaac ROS pipelines for VSLAM and navigation
- Understand Nav2 implementation for bipedal humanoid movement

## Module Overview

Perception and navigation are essential for autonomous robot operation. This module builds on the ROS 2 and simulation foundations from previous modules and introduces you to perception systems that allow robots to process sensor data and make movement decisions.

This module covers:
1. Isaac Sim photorealistic simulation + synthetic data
2. Isaac ROS pipelines: VSLAM, navigation
3. Nav2 for bipedal humanoid movement
