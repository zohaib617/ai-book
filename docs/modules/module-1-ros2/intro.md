# Module 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals

Welcome to the first module of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book. This module introduces you to the Robot Operating System (ROS 2), which serves as the "nervous system" for robots, enabling communication between different components.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Explain the core concepts of ROS 2 including Nodes, Topics, and Services
- Understand how rclpy bridges Python agents to ROS 2
- Describe the basics of URDF for humanoid robot structure

## Module Overview

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) is the middleware that enables communication between different robot components. It provides a framework for writing robot software and handles the complexity of distributed systems.

This module covers:
1. ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, and Services
2. rclpy: Python Agent to ROS 2 bridge
3. URDF basics for humanoid robots

Understanding these fundamentals is crucial as they form the foundation for all subsequent modules in this book.
