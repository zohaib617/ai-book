# Module 2: Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

This module covers digital twin simulation concepts using Gazebo and Unity. You'll learn how to test robot behaviors in virtual environments before real-world deployment, including physics simulation fundamentals and sensor modeling.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Explain Gazebo physics including gravity and collision simulation
- Describe sensor simulation for LiDAR, Depth, and IMU sensors
- Understand Unity's role in high-fidelity rendering and interaction

## Module Overview

Digital twin technology is critical for safe robot development and testing. This module builds on the ROS 2 fundamentals you learned in Module 1 and shows you how to create virtual environments where robots can be tested without risk.

This module covers:
1. Gazebo physics: gravity, collisions
2. Environment + sensor simulation (LiDAR, Depth, IMU)
3. Unity: high-fidelity rendering & interaction
